        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="边界">边界</h2>
<p>  我喜欢上“边界”这个词，源于美国反乌托邦小说《授者》。我也开始警觉自省，环视四周，果然，稀松的空气中有一条“边界”。我能感受到它。</p>
<p>  小说描绘了两条“边界”：一条有形，圈限人的行为与思考的边界；一条无形，设定人的职业、角色甚至情感的边界。由此，乌托邦建立，人们以各自适当的角色在适当的区域活动，直到主角乔纳斯冲破边界，释放人性中的一切善恶。同时，乔纳斯也冲破了另一层边界，以自由之姿向设置者进行反击。</p>
<p>  边界，英文“boundary”，词根为“bound”，即为捆绑、束缚、缠绕，犹如绷带缠绕木乃伊一样。绷带之于木乃伊，就是永恒的禁锢，使其在绷带所限区域内腐朽。想至此，不禁森然：边界于我看来即为一种圈限、束缚、牢狱，而画地为牢者可以是自己或是他人，也可以是社会价值观或是盲目的文凭主义之类。</p>
<p>  置身于边界中，我感到自己被占领了，被“他们”占领了。“他们”是操控程序的人，“他们”不一定是人，但确有其人。不仅我是如此，环视周围一张张脸，斑斑怯懦，点点怨愁，都是如此。因为在边界之中，因为设定好的角色，我们开始过分关注自我，关注自身存在状态的优劣，也因此对外界、对边界外广阔的世界失去了兴趣，由此丧失了冲动的激情和探求的动力，也丢失了冲破边界的勇气与羽翼。借萨特之言：我们沉浸其中，既感到不能忍受，却又与之相处愉快。确乎，忍受边界与拒绝忍受都是忍受，这种被圈困的感觉犹如吃了苍蝇一样，不将自己杀死是无法把它取出来的。我能感受到在边界、角色的荫翳下，自己失去了感动的爆发力，失去了对黎明、对新生的热爱，活在一种不闻、不动、无边的不正义中，任凭边界如绷带般慢慢收缩，榨干生命最后一滴血浆。</p>
<p>  正是由于对这种无形边界的不满，生命尝试着冲撞。在鲍鹏山的观点中，庄周几乎成功地冲破了对自己生命的定义，即冲破了边界。当他以“往矣！吾将曳尾于涂中”来拒绝尘嚣时，他跳开了一种边界的圈限，聪慧地远离了“火坑”。于是他像一棵独立守望心灵之月的树，由生站到了死。他似乎在跟世界比谁更无赖，谁更赤条条来去无牵挂，谁更无逻辑、无心肝。</p>
<p>  然而，这种冲撞的背后却听得见血泪的滴答声。庄子“眼冷心肠热”，对世界到底热肠挂肚，他对边界的冲撞成就了他曲高和寡的寥落才情。不仅庄周有如此尝试，艾丽丝·门罗亦在努力，在她的作品中，到处是罗素所言的“静静的绝望的真相”——不断地冲撞外力对自己的设定，却又不断地被挣扎的过去、无望的未来所捕获。在边界中，冲撞越猛，越被束缚，越易肝脑涂地，令人悚栗。</p>
<p>  所以冲破边界无望？</p>
<p>  在这永恒的生命困境中，我开始思考另外的途径。</p>
<p>  《死亡诗社》中的基丁老师站上讲桌，给了我一个方向。既然生命注定要被边界束缚，唯有扩大边界，站在边界之上，瞭望世界，才能免于那种不自觉的“木乃伊”状态。</p>
<p>  尼采曾有一句感伤之言：“宁愿绝望，胜于投降。”窃以为，不妨温柔些：“不如眺望，胜于投降，优于绝望。”以基丁为例，一个名校的老师，在所设的边界、角色内，保有清醒的双目，带领学生站在讲桌上，眺望万千世界中无尽的诗意与思趣，发出惠特曼所言的“野性的狂叫”。跃上讲桌的那一刻，学生在边界上打了个漂亮的“擦边球”，在眺望中看到了扩展的可能。</p>
<p>  这种想法与朱良志先生的“乾坤草亭”何其相似。他在对“亭子”这一物象的剖析中，发现了一种精妙的智慧。亭子，实为一种边界，然而和捆绑木乃伊的“绷带之界”不同，亭子四周无墙壁，能观亭外之物。坐于亭子中，既可遮挡一些风雨，又可眺望如烟景色，仰观宇宙之大，俯察品类之盛，在自由呼吸间精骛八极。此乐何极！由此观之，人该是在一种边界的范围内均匀呼吸，以扩展着的感觉和理性拓宽边界，由原点向外发散，思之无极。此可谓“不离亭子，不在亭子”的内在深意。这样的道理与远行之意不谋而合：所谓远行，该是带着对原点的怀念而上路的。正如边界是一个人在物质世界的立身之本一样， 唯有确立了一个生命的坐标，方有基础去探求。</p>
<p>  纵观“边界”之义，在我看来，人生所需的边界不该为绷带般的boundary，而该为四面通达的亭子。但无论置身于何地，扮演什么样的角色，都该怀有一份“狂躁”之感，一如前文的庄子、门罗，始终保有探求的冲动，始终在跃跃欲试的期待里不停地思考、冲撞。若非如此，无论在什么样的边界之中，你都会像一具被角色占领的木乃伊一般，任凭收缩的边界缩窄你的眼光，榨干你的脑浆。</p>
<p>  写到这里，我眼前浮现一幅画面：乾坤中芥籽般小亭，亭中一人神采飞扬。</p>

<p>我现在渴望的并非快乐，但求自己不要无知。<br>
《加缪手记》  阿尔贝·加缪<br>
<br><br>
越被禁止，越引好奇，就像那深渊一样。脚迈不到的地方，目光可以到达；视线看不到的地方，思想仍能继续。人不管多么软弱，多么无能，但没有人不愿一试。<br>

一切自然美的深处都藏着某些不合人情的东西，连绵山丘、柔媚天色、婆娑树影，霎时间便失去了我们所赋予的幻想意义，从此比失去的天堂更遥远了。<br>

<p>风经过，  <br>
轻易乱了白云的阵脚。  <br>
<br></p>
<p>山体被挖开巨口，<br>
而隧道终日沉默，<br>
等待——<br>
等待列车偶然的穿行。<br>
<br></p>
<p>纸张从虚空到圆满，<br>
亲历笔墨的死亡，<br>
最后，<br>
守着只言片语变皱变沧桑。<br>
<br></p>
<p>孤独矗立，<br>
存在就是为了粉碎障碍，<br>
拐杖和伞惺惺相惜。<br>
<br><br><br></p>
<p>蒸发——<br>
所有向上的事物皆轻盈欢畅，<br>
比如海洋湿气与林间浓雾，<br>
比如相爱时缥缈的心情。</p>
<p>欢聚——<br>
有关云朵的诸多元素:<br>
水滴、冰晶、微尘终于碰头，<br>
在虚浮的狂喜中构筑空中花园。</p>
<p>下坠——<br>
透支这座悬苑的筋骨，<br>
在低气压中开启雨的使命，<br>
以澄澈吞并污秽，以清冽安抚痛感。</p>
<p>云烟成雨，<br>
明日终将放晴。<br>
<br><br><br></p>
<p>爬山，从低谷跋涉至新的低谷。<br>
越冬，逃离十二月的霜雪，<br>
扎进二月的寒。<br>
所有曲折画成一个零。</p>
<p>而总有某些咬牙忍过的时刻不被虚度——<br>
山巅的稀薄空气值得胜者私藏;<br>
冬日偶然的回暖撩拨纷纷欲望。</p>
<p>端点，生命轨迹的启程与终结。<br>
伏线，时间精心预留的出口或者死路。<br>
事物总是两面——</p>
<p>英雄的灵魂与懦夫的胆子并不矛盾;<br>
少年郎心里也横尸遍野。<br>
<br><br><br></p>
<p>耗尽丁烷，耗尽烟草与浓雾，<br>
在虚设的火光中，<br>
亲眼目睹——<br>
猩红把黑暗灼穿几个窟窿;<br>
灰烬集体死亡，堆成坟头一角;</p>
<p>考验鼻腔，考验呼吸道与运气，<br>
此生如冻土般贫瘠，<br>
唯独不乏——<br>
延时的困倦与迟到的清醒，<br>
现代人的自由灵魂总擅长昼伏夜出。</p>
<p>如果可以，<br>
在这些被人为拉长的困倦长夜里，<br>
掐灭火光与失望，<br>
我想看到星光。<br>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sorry for the delay in posting. I needed a few days to get my head around what just happened.</p>
<p>It began, as everything did, with a big bang. There was apparently a gas leak in the house across the street. Of course, my time living with Sherlock means I know how meaningless the word 'apparently' can be. The police investigated and discovered that the house had been wired with explosives. The only other thing they found inside the house was a box. And inside the box was an envelope. And inside the envelope was, of all things, a bright pink phone. Regular readers of my blog might remember the case I called '<a href="http://www.johnwatsonblog.co.uk/blog/07february" title="A Study In Pink">A Study In Pink</a>' . Needless to say, it was a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>As is my sudden use of phrases like &quot;regular readers of my blog&quot;. It seems I'm starting to enjoy writing up my life. It helps, though, when I discover that half of Scotland Yard are reading it. More on that later!</p>
<p>So, we switched on the phone and there was a message.</p>
<p>Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.</p>
<p>Five beeps or pips. Sherlock knew immediately that it was a warning. There were these secret societies who used to send five orange pips to people as a threat. There was also a picture of an empty flat which Sherlock recognised. It was downstairs. 221C Baker Street! We rushed over there and discovered a pair of trainers.</p>
<p>And then the pink phone rang. It was a woman. She was crying. It turns out that whoever was organising all this had arranged for this woman to be kidnapped and wrapped in explosives. If she didn't say exactly what she was told to say... Sherlock, naturally, was immediately caught up in the adventure. Didn't even register that some innocent person somewhere was going through Hell. The crying woman told us we had twelve hours to solve the first problem.</p>
<p>We went to Barts so that Sherlock could examine the trainers. I, as usual, didn't have a clue what the question was never mind the answer. We met up with Molly Hooper who introduced us to her boyfriend, Jim. Apparently, he worked in IT. There's that word 'apparently' again. Oh, and I've just seen <a href="http://www.mollyhooper.co.uk/blog/25march" title="how they first met">how they first met</a> .</p>
<p>Anyway, Jim left and Sherlock revealed to Molly that the bloke was clearly gay. As usual, he didn't care that this might, you know, not exactly be what she wanted to hear!</p>
<p>So, back to the trainers. Sherlock naturally got me to humiliate myself by examining them myself and getting everything wrong. He told me that they were twenty years old and that the pollen on them revealed they were from Sussex. Then he remembered a name - Carl Powers, a boy who had died when Sherlock was a kid. Everyone had assumed it was a tragic swimming accident but Sherlock was always confused by the boy's missing trainers. Now they'd turned up twenty years later and addressed to him. Sherlock discovered traces of Clostridium botulinim on Carl's trainers and concluded that he'd been murdered - the poison having been introduced to Carl's eczema medicine. Sherlock needed to let the killer know he'd worked it out so he typed a message on his website. I know some of you were confused by his <a href="http://www.thescienceofdeduction.co.uk/forum/page4" title="bizarre posts the other day">bizarre posts the other day</a> .</p>
<p>The crying woman then phoned again and was allowed to tell us where she was. The police found her and she was ok. Sherlock pissed me off though. He described the whole set-up as elegant. I asked him what he meant and he said that &quot;I can't be the only person to get bored&quot;. Clearly, the killer was targeting him directly and he loved it.</p>
<p>Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.</p>
<p>Another message. Another photo. This time it was of an abandoned sports car. The phone rang. It was a man, as terrified as the woman had been earlier. He told us we had eight hours. â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“ from Scotland Yard located the car and Sherlock examined it. It had been hired from a company called Janus Cars by a man called â–“â–“â–“ â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“ - a man who had disappeared. This one was pretty straightforward for Sherlock. Just one chat with the missing man's wife and a visit to Janus Cars and he had it all wrapped up. It was a simple insurance scam. Again, he posted the answer on his blog. The man wrapped in explosives was found and released. Turns out he'd been in central London. God, if Sherlock had got it wrong... The other thing is, like I say, he was enjoying it. Him and this mysterious killer were playing a game. Me, Mrs H, the people with the bombs, everyone else, we were just pawns. I thought back to a name we'd heard a couple of times - Moriarty. Could this be him? When I mentioned this, Sherlock's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Beep. Beep. Beep.</p>
<p>Another message. A third photo. This time it was someone I recognised but Sherlock didn't have a clue who she was. It's nice to occasionally be the clever one. The picture was of the recently deceased <a href="http://www.connieprince.co.uk/" title="Connie Prince">Connie Prince</a> . Apparently, she'd died as a result of a tetanus infection but clearly our killer was suggesting otherwise. Again, we received a phone call. This time it was an old woman - and she was blind. I mean, who would do that? How could anyone do that? I went along to visit Connie's brother, Kenny. Sherlock went onto some internet forums and, with his usual tact and diplomacy, <a href="%5B%E9%93%BE%E6%8E%A5%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%5D(http://www.connieprince.co.uk/message-board)" title="got answers that way">got answers that way</a> . Between us, we worked out that while Connie's death had been made to look like the result of a tetanus infection, it had actually been caused by poison - their houseboy, â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“, had overdosed her on Botox! It would have almost been funny were it not for what happened next. Sherlock posted a message to his blog and, like before, the old woman called us. But this one made a mistake. She started to tell us about the man who'd tied her up and... He blew her up.</p>
<p>She lived in a block of flats. In Glasgow. Twelve people died.</p>
<p>I still can't quite get my head around it. This game between Sherlock and his... nemesis? Is that the right word? Twelve totally random innocent people had died because of it. I got so angry with Sherlock that morning. He didn't care. He admitted it. He just didn't care. As he pointed out, caring wouldn't save lives. I asked him if he found it easy not to care and he said yes. It was that simple. Maybe Sally Donovan is right. Maybe he is a freak.</p>
<p>Beep. Beep.</p>
<p>Another photo. This time of the Thames. Sherlock called Scotland Yard and they told him about a body that had been pulled out of the river. We went along and within minutes, Sherlock had worked out he was a security guard and that he was probably linked to a lost painting that had recently been rediscovered and put on display at the Hickman Gallery. Oh, and he revealed that the painting was a fake. I could explain how he did it but I think it's one of those 'you had to be there' moments. He also worked out what had killed the security guard. I say 'what' although technically it was 'who'. But, having seen the man, 'what' is probably a better definition. He was an assassin known as the Golem. He killed people by squeezing the air out of their body with his bare hands! Why he would have done this to some poor security guard was still a mystery so I went to the guy's flat and discovered a voicemail message from a Professor â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“. She had called him in response to him having discovered that something somewhere was wrong. The only other clue was that he was into astronomy. Sherlock worked out that the Golem had killed the security guard because he'd worked out that the painting was a fake. We concluded that Professor â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“ worked at a planetarium and rushed over there. But we were too late. The Golem was there and it killed her. Then, it attacked Sherlock. I don't think I've actually seen him scared before. Me, I was bricking it! I'd seen horror in Afghanistan. But this man was barely human. He really was a monster! I managed to rescue Sherlock (by whacking the Golem with my gun - I never said I was subtle) but the creature got away.</p>
<p>We returned to the gallery and Sherlock confronted the curator. She denied everything - insisting that the painting was real - and there didn't seem to be much we could do. Then the phone rang once more.</p>
<p>It was a child.</p>
<p>The child started to count down from ten. Sherlock was screaming into the phone that the painting was a fake but the killer clearly wanted proof. Sherlock stared at the painting as the child continued to count down to his own death. And then Sherlock, at the last minute, worked it out. It was how the security guard had guessed it was a fake and why he'd phoned a professor at a planetarium. There was a supernova in the painting that didn't appear in our skies until 1858. Therefore, the painting couldn't have been painted by an artist living in the 1640s. The child stopped counting.</p>
<p>The curator admitted that she'd arranged for the painting to be created. She'd been put in touch with various people and they'd all seemed to be working for one man. You've guessed it. Moriarty.</p>
<p>Back at the flat, and we waited for another call. Nothing seemed to be happening though so I decided to visit my girlfriend, Sarah. I had just left the flat when a taxi pulled up alongside me. The taxi driver asked if I wanted a lift but I told him I was getting the Tube. He then said that he hadn't been asking me, he'd been telling me. I looked at him and I saw the gun pointing at me and so I got into the taxi.</p>
<p>They must have knocked me out because the next thing I can remember is waking up to the smell of chlorine. I was in a sports centre, near the swimming pool. And I was wearing a bomb. I could feel it under the jacket they'd put me in. Then a voice sounded in my ear and I realised I was wearing some kind of earpiece. It said that I knew the drill and I was to repeat word-for-word what he said otherwise I'd never be writing my blog again.</p>
<p>I was made to walk out into the swimming pool area where, I discovered, Sherlock was waiting. The voice in my ear, which I vaguely recognised, told me to say some stuff - which, I realised, gave the impression that I was behind it all. That I, John Watson, was Moriarty. I could see the look in Sherlock's eyes - a flash of, not anger, but hurt. For a second, he looked like a little, lost child. I should have been horrified that he'd even doubt me for a second but, to be honest, it was so refreshingly human of him. He actually did value our friendship. He did, despite himself, care. Then he saw the explosives on me and he realised what was happening.</p>
<p>And at that moment, out stepped Moriarty. It was Jim. Molly Hooper's boyfriend from the IT department at Barts! Even that little meeting had been part of the game. The two men talked, both clearly pleased to, at last, be face to face. Again, I felt like a pawn in their game. Especially when a laser sight appeared on my chest. One wrong move and some stranger in the dark would shoot the explosives. I watched as they talked. Jim Moriarty was the total opposite to Sherlock but they were also so very alike. He was a consulting criminal. People came to him and he arranged whatever they wanted. And while they talked, I stood there wearing enough explosives to kill all of us. I was the only one who seemed even aware of this. Suddenly, I grabbed Moriarty. I knew that his assistant (his John Watson?) wouldn't kill him. But the laser sight simply moved to Sherlock's head and I was forced to let go. For a second, I wondered if Sherlock would have done the same for me but then all I knew for certain was, at that moment, I knew I was going to die.</p>
<p>Except I didn't because Moriarty changed his mind. He said that he'd kill Sherlock one day but that, for now, he was letting us go. It really was just a game to him. He left and Sherlock ripped the explosives off of me. We were getting our breath back when suddenly so many laser sights appeared. Moriarty returned and said he had changed his mind again!! We were going to die, after all. Sherlock simply pointed his gun at the discarded explosives. If we were going to die, so was Moriarty.</p>
<p>I held my breath for what seemed like months. I had no idea what either of them would do. Moriarty clearly had no discernible human feelings and Sherlock had claimed not to care. Could this be it? Was I really going to die? In a sports centre?</p>
<p>Which is when Moriarty's phone rang. He took the call and called off his gunman. He was letting us live. And, as I finally breathed out, he left.</p>
<p>And that's how Sherlock Holmes and I lived to see another day.</p>
